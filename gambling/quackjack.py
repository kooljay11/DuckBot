                ## Objective
                The objective of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.
    
                ## Card Values
                - Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
                - Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10.
                - Aces can be worth 1 or 11, whichever is more advantageous you.
    
                ## Gameplay
                1. **Initial Deal**: You place your bet, then the dealer deals two cards to you and themselves. One of the dealer's cards is face-up and the other one is face-down.
    
                2. **Your Turn**: You can decide whether to:
                   - Hit: Take another card.
                   - Stand: Keep the current hand.
                   - Double Down: Double the bet and take one more card.
                   - Split: If dealt a pair (same value cards), split them into two separate hands and double the bet.
    
                3. **Dealer's Turn**: After you finished your turn, the dealer reveals their face-down card.
                   - If the dealer has 16 or less, they must hit.
                   - If the dealer has 17 or more, they must stand.
    
                4. **Winning and Losing**: You win if your hand beats the dealer's without going over 21. If you bust (exceeds 21), you lose your bet. A tie results in a push (bet returned)."""

            ## Special Actions
            
            ### Split
            - When dealt a pair, you can choose to split them into two separate hands.
            - Each hand receives an additional card, and you play each hand separately.
            - A bet equal to the original is placed on the second hand.
            - When splitting Aces, you can only receive one additional card for each hands and then must stand.
            
            ### Doubling Down
            - You can choose to double your original bet after receiving your first two cards or after a split (excepted when splitting Aces).
            - You receive one additional card and then must stand.
            
            ### Insurance
            - If the dealer's face-up card is an Ace, you can choose to make an insurance bet.
            - The insurance bet is a separate side bet, up to half of the original bet, and pays 2:1 if the dealer has a natural blackjack.
            - If the dealer does not have a natural blackjack, the insurance bet is lost.
            
            ### Surrender
            - You are allowed to surrender your hand after the initial deal.
            - Surrendering forfeits half of the original bet, and you exit the hand.
            
            ## Tips for Beginners
            - Aim to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.
            - Pay attention to the dealer's upcard to make strategic decisions.
            - Practice basic strategy to optimize your chances of winning."""
